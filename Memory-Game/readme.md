# Memory Game Project

## Objective
Create a simple memory game where players flip cards to find matching pairs. The game should be visually appealing and responsive.

## Requirements
1. **Game Board**:
   - A grid of cards (e.g., 4x4 or 6x6).
   - Each card has a hidden image or symbol.
   - Cards are shuffled and placed face down at the start.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Players click on a card to flip it.
   - If two flipped cards match, they remain face up.
   - If they don't match, they flip back after a short delay.
   - The game ends when all pairs are found.

3. **User Interface**:
   - A timer to track how long it takes to complete the game.
   - A counter to track the number of moves made.
   - A reset button to restart the game.

4. **Styling**:
   - Use CSS or a CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS) for styling.
   - Ensure the game is responsive and works on different screen sizes.

5. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - Use JavaScript to handle game logic, card flipping, and matching.
   - Implement a shuffle function to randomize card positions.
   - Use event listeners for card clicks and game reset.

## Concepts to Be Tested
DOM manipulation, event handling, array methods, loops, conditional statements, functions, CSS integration, responsive design, timers, state management, debugging, code organization, modularity, user interaction, animations, performance optimization.
