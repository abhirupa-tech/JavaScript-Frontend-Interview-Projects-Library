# Memory Game Project

## Objective
Create a simple memory game where players flip cards to find matching pairs. The game should be visually appealing and responsive.

## Requirements
1. **Game Board**:
   - A grid of cards (e.g., 4x4 or 6x6).
   - Each card has a hidden image or symbol.
   - Cards are shuffled and placed face down at the start.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Players click on a card to flip it.
   - If two flipped cards match, they remain face up.
   - If they don't match, they flip back after a short delay.
   - The game ends when all pairs are found.

3. **User Interface**:
   - A timer to track how long it takes to complete the game.
   - A counter to track the number of moves made.
   - A reset button to restart the game.

4. **Styling**:
   - Use CSS or a CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS) for styling.
   - Ensure the game is responsive and works on different screen sizes.

5. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - Use JavaScript to handle game logic, card flipping, and matching.
   - Implement a shuffle function to randomize card positions.
   - Use event listeners for card clicks and game reset.

## Concepts to Be Tested
1. **DOM Manipulation**:
   - Creating and updating elements dynamically.
   - Handling user interactions with event listeners.

2. **JavaScript Logic**:
   - Implementing game logic for matching pairs and tracking moves.
   - Using arrays and loops to manage the game state.

3. **CSS Styling**:
   - Applying styles to create a visually appealing and responsive game.
   - Using CSS transitions for smooth card flipping animations.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensuring the game works well on different screen sizes and devices.

5. **Code Organization**:
   - Writing clean, modular, and maintainable code.
   - Using functions to encapsulate different parts of the game logic.

6. **Debugging and Testing**:
   - Identifying and fixing bugs in the game logic.
   - Testing the game to ensure it works as expected.

By following these specifications, you should be able to build a memory game in about an hour. This project will help you demonstrate your skills in JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and responsive design. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
