## Introduction
This library is designed to help developers prepare for frontend interviews by providing a variety of small to intermediate JavaScript projects. Each project is aimed at improving your coding skills and understanding of key frontend concepts.

# Setting Up Your Project Branch and Folder on GitHub

Follow these steps to create your own branch, set up a project folder, and push your code to GitHub. Additionally, use GitHub Codespaces to streamline your workflow.

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```

---

## Step 2: Create and Switch to a New Branch

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

Replace `<branch_name>` with a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `feature/project-setup`).

---

## Step 3: Create Your Project Folder

1. Navigate to the desired location in the repository.
2. Create a new folder for your project.

For example:
```bash
mkdir <project_folder_name>
cd <project_folder_name>
```

Replace `<project_folder_name>` with the name of your project.

---

## Step 4: Add Your Code

1. Add your project files to the newly created folder.
2. Stage and commit the changes:

```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit for <project_folder_name>"
```

---

## Step 5: Push Your Branch to GitHub

```bash
# Push the branch to the remote repository
git push origin <branch_name>
```

---

## Step 6: Use GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces allows you to develop directly in the cloud without setting up a local environment.

### Steps to Use Codespaces:

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Code** button and select **Codespaces**.
3. Create a new Codespace or open an existing one for your branch.
4. Codespaces will automatically set up your development environment.
5. Make changes and commit directly from the Codespace terminal or editor.

---

## Step 7: Create a Pull Request

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click on **Pull Requests**.
3. Click **New Pull Request** and select your branch.
4. Add a description of your changes and submit the pull request.

---

## Additional Notes
- Ensure you regularly pull updates from the main branch to avoid merge conflicts:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout <branch_name>
git merge main
```

- Test your changes thoroughly before creating a pull request.
