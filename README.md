### Setting Up Your Project Branch and Folder on GitHub
Follow these steps to create your own branch, set up a project folder, and push your code to GitHub.


### Commands

# Clone the repository
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b <branch_name>

# Create your project folder
mkdir <project_folder_name>
cd <project_folder_name>

# Add your project files (manually or programmatically)

# Stage and commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for <project_folder_name>"

# Push your branch to GitHub
git push origin <branch_name>

# (Optional) Keep your branch up-to-date with main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout <branch_name>
git merge main
```


### Use GitHub Codespaces
<i> GitHub Codespaces allows you to develop directly in the cloud without setting up a local environment. </i>

#### Steps to Use Codespaces:
1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Code** button and select **Codespaces**.
3. Create a new Codespace or open an existing one for your branch.
4. Codespaces will automatically set up your development environment.
5. Make changes and commit directly from the Codespace terminal or editor.

### Create a Pull Request
- Add a description of your changes and submit the pull request.
- Test your changes thoroughly before creating a pull request.
- Always add images
